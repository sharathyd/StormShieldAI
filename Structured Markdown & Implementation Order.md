# StormShield AI — Montgomery's Smart Flood & Weather Guardian

## Overview
StormShield AI is a distributed flood prediction and civic alert architecture consisting of a FastAPI backend and a Streamlit frontend. The system implements a real-time data ingestion pipeline that polls USGS stream gauges and NOAA weather forecasts, applies rolling-window smoothing and Z-score outlier filtering via SciPy, and generates water level predictions for T+30 minutes using a trained XGBoost regressor. Alert metadata is processed by Google Gemini 2.0 Flash to generate plain-language advisory text, while a custom RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) engine handles grounded user queries. The frontend provides a high-fidelity dashboard featuring dual-theme glassmorphism (Midnight Nimbus/Coastal Mist), STRtree-based spatial risk lookups, and a multi-scenario simulation engine for stress-testing flood response.

## Functional Modules

### Module 1: Data Ingestion & Signal Processing
The system uses `APScheduler` to poll USGS and NOAA APIs. Raw stream gauge data is processed through a dual-stage filter: a 15-minute rolling mean to reduce noise, followed by a Z-score outlier filter. Bright Data is used to scrape dynamic EMA alerts and raw FEMA flood zone GeoJSON data, keeping the database updated.

### Module 2: Flood Prediction Engine
The prediction pipeline constructs a 9-dimensional feature vector containing historical water levels, discharge rates, and rainfall proxies. This vector is fed into an XGBoost regressor to predict values at T+30 minutes. A confidence score is derived by comparing model residual variance against a baseline.

### Module 3: Advisory & Query Systems (LLM)
Alert levels are evaluated against Montgomery's flood stage thresholds. If a threat is detected, the system uses Gemini 2.0 Flash to generate a plain-language alert. The system also includes a RAG-powered query engine that grounding user questions in the latest sensor and spatial data context.

### Module 4: Spatial Analytics (Address Lookup)
Users can input any address in Montgomery to receive a localized risk report. The backend geocodes the address and performs a high-speed point-in-polygon search using a `Shapely.STRtree` index over FEMA GeoJSON features.

## Data Models

### Database Layers (SQLite)
- **`flood_zones` Table**: Persistent spatial database storing FEMA geometry for fast queries.
- **`subscribers` Table**: User contact tracking for the SMS broadcast system.

    timestamp: datetime
    water_level_ft: float
    discharge_cfs: float

class RainfallForecast(BaseModel):
    timestamp: datetime
    precipitation_mm: float
    wind_speed_mph: float

class PredictionResult(BaseModel):
    predicted_level_ft: float
    estimated_crest_iso: datetime
    confidence_score: float         # 0.0 – 1.0 logic
```

### Alert and Query Schemas
```python
class AlertStatus(BaseModel):
    level: Literal["RED", "YELLOW", "GREEN"]
    predicted_level_ft: float
    rate_of_rise_ft_per_15m: float
    alert_text: str                 # LLM-generated string
    generated_at: datetime

class QueryResponse(BaseModel):
    question: str
    answer: str
    grounded_at: datetime           # Context snapshot timestamp
```

## UI Components

### Dashboard Layout
The Dashboard is built as a responsive 4-tab interface with dual-theme support (Dark/Light mode).
- **Tab 1: Live Dashboard**: Integrated Folium map with FEMA polygons and Plotly dual-axis charts showing actual vs predicted trends.
- **Tab 2: Situation Report**: A data-dense filterable table showing historical alert cycles and the full text of latest advisories.
- **Tab 3: Ask StormShield AI**: A RAG-powered chat interface using Streamlit's native `st.chat_message` components.
- **Tab 4: Weather Analysis**: Detailed weather breakdown using Open-Meteo data, focusing on precipitation probability and temperature trends.
- **Tab 5: SMS Alerts**: A subscription form for users to sign up for emergency flood alerts via SMS (powered by 2factor.in).

### Theme & Interaction
The application implements a unique glassmorphic injection system for themes.
- **Midnight Nimbus**: A deep navy/black theme with electric cyan metrics.
- **Coastal Mist**: A high-contrast light theme using soft azure gradients.
- **Simulation Sidebar**: Allows users to stress-test the UI by injecting "Moderate", "High", or "Flood" scenarios.
